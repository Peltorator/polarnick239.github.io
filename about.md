My home in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. Here I am trying to do something interesting in Computer Vision.

GPUs raw power impresses me - so my field of interest includes CG, OpenCL, raytracing and amazing magics from [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/).

If you want to discuss something - my areas of expertise described in [CV](/old/cv/Polyarniy_CV.pdf).
