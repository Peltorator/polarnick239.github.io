My home is in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. Here I am trying to do something interesting in Computer Vision.

GPUs raw power impresses me - so my field of interest includes CG, OpenCL, raytracing and amazing magics from [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/).

Most part of my professional experience described in my [CV](/old/cv/Polyarniy_CV.pdf).
